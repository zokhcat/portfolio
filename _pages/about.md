18-year-old programmer who enjoys developing software. For the past three years, I have been involved in the programming community. Check out [/r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn),[/r/ProgrammerHumor](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/). I am into fintech and developer toolchain products.

I did a software engineering internship at [Helmer](https://helmer.app/). I wrote a book about building web apps!!! Take a look, [Hypebeast](https://notionpress.com/read/hypebeast).

Interesting papers I read this month - [Graph Transformation in SWE](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/231/y11/papers/graphtrans.pdf), [Amazon's Dynamo DB](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf)
